Project : Personal Movie Tracker
Author : Laur√®ne de Blauwe

# Description of the project
This project is an application used to track the movies you see with five categories
- Movie name
- The date you watched the movie
- The people you watched the movie with
- The description of the movie (it can be a resume or juste your personal opinion)
- The rate (out of 5)

# Tools used for the project
For this project, I used Java and the tools proposed by Android. I also used Jetpack to provide a database to store my data.

# Architecture of the project
There are two main pages : 
- The first page is the Home page. The aim of this page is to show you your statistics. For example, the last movie you see and your top 3.
- The second page is the Reviews page. This page shows you all of your reviews, in a a list of card you can expanse to see the different categories for each movie.

There is also a add button on each of the pages to add a new review. To add a review, you must fill of all the categories, except the people you watch the peope with. If you watch the movie alone, you don't have to specify it. When all the categories are filled, you can click on the submit button and your review will be add in the database and appear on the reviews page.

# How to use the project ?
You can run it locally with Android Studio and start creating your reviews
